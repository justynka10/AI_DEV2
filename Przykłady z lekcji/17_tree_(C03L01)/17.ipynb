At this stage, I have approximately 2000 users of this app and I'm the only developer (can't change atm). This success signals that I may need to invest more resources into this project. Currently, I am the only developer of this app. Moreover, this is not my only project; I have several others, which necessitates careful time management and focus. I am faced with the decision of choosing between two paths:\n",

This will provide me with much more flexibility when implementing even the most advanced features requested by users, although I cannot guarantee they will actually use them.
